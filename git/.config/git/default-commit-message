# <type>[optional scope]: <description>
#
# [optional body]

# [optional footer(s)]

# Type can be 
#    feat     (new feature)
#    fix      (bug fix)
#    refactor (refactoring production code)
#    style    (formatting, missing semi colons, etc; no code change)
#    docs     (changes to documentation)
#    test     (adding or refactoring tests; no production code change)
#    build    (changes that affect the build system or external dependencies)
#    ci       (changes to CI configuration files and scripts)
#    perf     (changes that improves performance)
#    chore    (config updates, scripts, etc. no production code change)
# --------------------
# Remember to
#    Appends a ! after the type/scope if there are breaking changes
#    Use the imperative mood in the description
#    Do not end the description line with a period
#    Separate description from body with a blank line
#    Use the body to explain what and why vs. how
#    Can use multiple lines with "-" for bullet points in body
